Implementation notes on this mockup:

== Data source ==

Pages are loaded in an <iframe> from http://en.wikipedia.org using
?useformat=mobile. They are currently loaded through a local .php proxy
which hides the mobile-view header/footer and injects a script to modify
behavior to cooperate with the parent frame.

This frame embedding (using HTML5 postMessage) style, if integrated into
the regular raw views, could make it easier for mockups and alternate UI
tools to hook in without modification in future, without exposing direct
XSS vectors between the two sides...



== Screen size ==

CSS media queries are used to check the screen. If 640px or wider, we
enable the 'tablet' mode with wider buttons, more visible entries on the
top bar.

If smaller, we use the 'mobile' mode with more compact buttons, things
folded etc.


Using CSS media queries lets a lot of the layout logic happen on its own
without having to ship separate code for small and medium screens. For
mobile web and PhoneGap-style apps this makes it easier to ship a single
codebase that runs on both sizes.

Some systems may also allow dynamically resizing the screen, such as the
side-by-side "snapped" application view in Windows 8's Metro environment.
This allows the app to automatically retool itself to fit a smaller or
larger subset of the screen.

When testing in a regular browser, you can see this in action by sizing
the browser window to wider or narrower than 640px.


== Scrolling ==

The embedding iframe is sized to match its content, so the outer document as a whole scrolls.

Top & bottom toolbars float using position: fixed (warning: limited browser support!), with
automatic switching to inline in the page layout when you reach the footer.


== Known issues ==

* search not yet implemented
* footer buttons & links not yet implemented
* login-y features not yet implemented
* "you" pop-up menu details in mobile view not yet implemented
* tap to show toolbars in mobile view not yet implemented
* icons only at medium density (will be blocky or blurry on high-res phones)
* hash links like references and 'jump back a section' don't appear to be working consistently?
* no blue selected background gradient for buttons yet
** CSS gradients go into the background-image slot, which is being used for the icons. may need to turn the icons into <img>s or something
* clicking article/discuss doesn't switch the sliders around yet
** this may require restructuring :)
* 2-3 pixels of empty space appear between the bottom of the <iframe> and the top of the toolbar below it when docked. These appear as black (outer document background) :(
** related: pretty sliders in mockups have a transparent part, not implemented
* sizing of buttons/sliders isn't right yet


Firefox 7 / Desktop
* phone & tablet sizes ok

Firefox 8 / Android
* position: fixed elements scroll along with the document, don't restore to proper position until scrolling is complete

Opera Mobile 11.50 / Android
* position: fixed elements scroll along with the document, don't restore to proper position until scrolling is complete

Mobile Safari - iOS 4.3 simulator
* position: fixed elements behave as position: absolute

Mobile Safari - iOS 5 simulator
* bottom bar docking/undocking happens after ending a scroll, instead of as you scroll past the boundary ('scroll' event not fired until the end)

Android 2.3.6 stock browser
* position: fixed elements work, but sometimes update slowly or don't refresh properly onscreen

IE 10 (Windows 8 Developer Preview)
* position: fixed elements work, but update slowly
